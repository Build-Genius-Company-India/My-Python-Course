Hello World!

To print text in Python, use the print() function:

print("Hello World!")
Note: Text inside quotation marks is case-sensitive.

Comments

Comments in Python:

1. Single-line comments:

# This is a single-line comment
2. Multi-line comments:

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
Comments are ignored by the compiler and used for code explanation.

Numbers

Variables in Python:

Containers that hold data values
Used to store, manipulate, and display information
Have a unique name and a value
Python automatically detects variable type
Variable initialization format:

variable_name = value
Number types:

int: whole numbers (e.g., 1, -2)
float: real numbers (e.g., 1.32, 0.98)
Examples:

a = 3    # int
b = 13.2 # float

String

A char is a single character (e.g., 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T).

A str (string) is a sequence of multiple characters.

To create a string variable, enclose the text in single or double quotes:

s1 = 'This is a string'
s2 = "This is also a string"
Both single and double quotes are valid for creating strings in Python.

Boolean

A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.

To assign a bool value to a variable,

variable_true = True
variable_false = False
In the above example, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.

Booleans are the building blocks for creating logic in the programs we write. We have a whole chapter about logic and conditions.

Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are a set of guidelines that developers follow to make their code more readable and maintainable. Different programming languages often have different naming conventions. In python, variables are written in snake case - words are separated by underscores.

When writing a variable name be descriptive and use meaningful words

For example 

# Bad Naming
isActive = False # not snake case
a = 10
b = "Hello"
x = True

# Good Naming
age = 10
greeting = "Hello"
is_active = True

Empty Variables

In Python, None is a special value that represents "nothing" or "no value." It's like an empty box - it exists, but there's nothing inside it. For example:

empty_box = None
In a real scenario you could use None to indicate that something was not initialized yet.

For example:

score = None  # Score hasn't been calculated yet
name = None   # Name hasn't been entered yet
