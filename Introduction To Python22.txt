### The Language 

Python is one of the world's easiest and most popular programming languages.

### Hello World!

The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen.

In Python, we use print() to show words on the screen. The words go inside quotation marks.

Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in Python:

print("Hello World!")

Challenge

Beginner
Use the code view to write a program that outputs Hello World!

Note that anything inside quotation marks is case sensitive. For example:

print("Hello World!")
print("hello world!")
are different things (notice the capital letters in the first line).
solution --
print ("Hello World!")

Comments

Comments are used to add explanatory notes within the code. They are ignored by the compiler and are meant for human understanding.

In Python, there are two ways to write comments:

Single-line comments using the # symbol:
# This is a comment
print("Hello!")  # This prints "Hello!"

# You can use comments to explain your code
print("Python is fun!")  # This will show on the screen 

Multi-line comments using triple quotes ("""):

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write multiple lines
of explanation here.
"""
print("Welcome!")
## You can use comments to explain your code
print("Python is fun!")  # This will show on the screen
Multi-line comments using triple quotes ("""):

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write multiple lines
of explanation here.
"""
print("Welcome!")

You're reviewing a colleague's Python script and notice they've used # TODO: Implement error handling. What is the purpose of this comment?

1
To disable a line of code

2
To create a multi-line comment

3
To indicate a future task

4
To mark a completed task
